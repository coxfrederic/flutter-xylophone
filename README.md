Added functionality to the App Brewery Flutter course module for Xylophone. Added the ability to "record" what has been played and replay that history at the exact same speed. A progress bar shows the progress of the history being played.

This was my own added interpretation for adding complexity to the module, while learning Flutter.

Thanks to https://twitter.com/jikiwiki for helping me on the ChangeNotifier for updating the progressbar.

## Our Goal

In this tutorial we will be diving into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, you should be comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.

## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
